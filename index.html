        <code><p>Rocket League is an online game developed by Psyonix and released on 7th July 2015. The game was released as a follow-up to "Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars". Since its release, Rocket League has become a very popular online e-sports game â€” most notably after its decision to switch to a free-to-play model. It is available on PC, Playstation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.
        </p>
        <p>Competitive aspects of the game require extensive knowledge in order to perform.

        <code>
          <p>Rocket League consists of three game modes: </p>
        </code>
        <ul class="mode-types">
          <li>3v3</li>
          <li>2v2</li>
          <li>1v1</li>
        </ul>
        <code>
        <p>These game modes can be played in both a ranked and casual environment. There are separate modes available as casual-only: Rumble, hoops, snowday, and dropshot. </p>

        <header class="topic">Ranked Matchmaking</header>
       <code>
        <p>Rocket league utilises a ranked matchmaking system that recalibrates MMR (Match-making rating) after each win and loss. This MMR determines the skill of opponents that each player will face. </p>
        <p>In each game mode, ranks will be determined by a player's MMR.</p>
        <ul class="rank-types">
          <li>Bronze</li>
          <li>Silver</li>
          <li>Gold</li>
          <li>Platinum</li>
          <li>Diamond</li>
          <li>Champ</li>

      <!--Fourth heading and content "Boost"-->
      <section class="main-section" id="Boost">
        <header class="topic">Boost</header>
        <code>
        <p>Boost allows players to rapidly increase forward momentum and perform aerial movements. Using boost will deplete the gauge located at the bottom-right of the user's screen. Boost has a minimum of 0% in which case the user can no longer use boost. There is also a maximum boost of 100%.</p>
        <p>Boost can be added to a player's boost gauge by driving over the available boost pads. Smaller boost pads will recharge 12%, while larger boost pads give 100%. Only six boost pads are available on the field.</p>
        <p>Boost can be consumed while jumping to perform aerials, changing the dynamic of gameplay.</p>

        <code>
        <p>Aerials are classified as a beginner mechanic that players are able to perform in order to reach the ball when it is too high too reach. </p>
        <p>To perform an aerial:</p>
        </code>
        <div class="aerial-explanation">
          Jump + Boost + Joystick Down
        </div>
        <code>
        <p>A fast aerial can be performed by using jump once airborne and performing an aerial. Note: Players must release the joystick when jumping on the second instance. Fast Aerials allow players to reach heights even faster.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Flip_Resets">
        <header class="topic">Flip Resets</header>
        <code>
        <p>Flip resets are a high level mechanic which allow players to utilise a double-jump. While a double-jump can be gained by driving on a flat surface, players must aerial onto a mid-air ball and aim their car to land flat on the ball using air-roll and the joystick.</p>
        <p>Flip-resets can be performed in conjuction with air-dribbles in order to score the ball.</p>
